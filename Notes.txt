1. index.html cannot find link like: ./bower_components/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css
The start point of factory is no in static directory.
Solution: 
app.py:
as-was: app = Flask(__name__)
as-is: app = Flask(__name__,static_url_path='')

2. Menu items
in app.js:
 var data = [props1, props2, props3];
 
3. Event registion is in app.js
Event controllor is in manager.js

4. In order to deploy to Heroku.
